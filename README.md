# TEOHENG Online Booking System

Teo Heng KTV is a karaoke chain in Singapore that is known for its affordable prices and casual atmosphere for groups to sing and enjoy music together in private rooms.
Although Teo Heng has experienced both successes and challenges in recent years, one issue that Teo Heng faces is the lack of an online booking system. This has put the company at a disadvantage compared to its local competitors that have implemented the online booking systems, allowing customers to conveniently book their karaoke sessions online.

This results in Teo Heng losing out on potential customers who prefer the convenience of booking their sessions online, especially during peak hours where the demand for karaoke rooms is high. Furthermore, it has resulted in operational inefficiencies such as long waiting times during the phone call whilst booking and clogged phone lines. As a result, consumers are having difficulty scheduling karaoke sessions, and the company is losing potential revenue due to missed bookings.

The solutions proposed have been crafted with the increasing Teo Heng revenue in the long run in mind - as such, we propose an online booking system to keep up with the technologically advanced world. The online booking systems have been designed based on customersâ€™ feedback and the features are not lacking compared to the local competitors.
